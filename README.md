This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The difficulty can be adjusted, providing varying numbers of attempts.

This is also sample solution for the [task-manager](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).
